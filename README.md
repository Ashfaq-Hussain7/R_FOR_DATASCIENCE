## ðŸ§ª Lab Cycle 1 â€“ Basics of R Programming

1. **Text Analysis:**  
   - Count total words, average word length, longest word, word replacement.
2. **Caesar Cipher:**  
   - Encrypt user input with specified shift.
3. **Student Record Validator:**  
   - Validate age, grade, and compute average age.
4. **Password Generator:**  
   - Generate random password with user-defined length.
5. **Series Summation:**  
   - Calculate sum of series `1 - 2/3 + 3/5 - 4/7 + ...`.
6. **Prime Number Checker:**  
   - Single number + range-based prime check using loops/functions.
7. **Fibonacci with a Twist:**  
   - Generate Fibonacci series using sum of last 3 terms.
8. **Palindrome Checker:**  
   - Check if a string is a palindrome (ignoring punctuation/spaces).
9. **Run-Length Encoding:**  
   - Implement string compression.
10. **Custom List Reversal:**  
   - Reverse a list without built-in functions/loops.

1. **Scatterplot (iris):**  
   - Sepal.Length vs Petal.Length with labels & saved image.
2. **Scatterplot (mtcars):**  
   - mpg vs disp, colored by cyl, with trendline.
3. **Bar Plot (mtcars):**  
   - Count of cylinders by transmission type.
4. **Histogram (mtcars):**  
   - mpg with blue shades, mean & SD annotations.
5. **Boxplot (mtcars):**  
   - hp vs gear (with outlier labels).
6. **Scatterplot (disp vs wt):**  
   - Colored/sized by carb, with trendline.
7. **Time Series Plot (COVID-19):**  
   - Real-world data from Kaggle.
8. **EDA (Titanic Dataset):**  
   - Histogram, statistical analysis, boxplot for age.
9. **EDA (Iris Dataset):**  
   - ANOVA on Sepal.Length, pairplot for all variables.

## ðŸ“Š Lab Cycle 3 â€“ Modeling, Graphs & Time Series

1. **Linear Regression (House Prices):**  
   - Fit model on size vs price, plot with regression line.
2. **Graph Algorithms (Adjacency + DFS):**  
   - Add edge & DFS traversal implementation.
3. **Correlation Analysis (mtcars):**  
   - Pearson correlation between hp and mpg.
4. **ANOVA (mtcars):**  
   - One-way ANOVA for disp across gear types.
5. **Time Series (COVID-19):**  
   - Univariate and multivariate analysis with forecasting using ARIMA.
6. **Boston Housing Analysis:**  
   - Exploratory data analysis, regression, prediction of median house value.
